# weather-dashboard
This project is a weather dashboard app with search functionality to find current weather conditions and forecasted weather for multiple cities. It uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve data for the cities, along with HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and displays a search history which the user can click to access previous cities searched via local storage.
